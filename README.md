# Project Description

Kelvingrover is designed to give users an informative and enjoyable experience when exploring
Kelvingrove Park. We want this to be applicable to all visitors, whether it is their first time visiting
the area, or a part of their daily commute. As such, Kelvingrover will be an online repository of
selected walks and cycle routes throughout the park - presented using an interactive map - with
selected tourist attractions highlighted on the map. A user can then go on to find out more
information about any of the attractions by selecting them on the map. This will provide an
information card on the attraction to the user, giving them historical context to what they can see.
While some routes will likely overlap in sections, we hope to provide enough variety to encourage
users to return to it many times.
